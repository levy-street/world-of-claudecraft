# Masterwrought: cross-phase state

Current phase: 02 COMPLETE including QA (PASS, fix round 6175c95836, 2026-08-07); next is phase 03 (IP naming sweep, phase-03-naming-sweep.md). Packet authored 2026-08-07.
Branch: `feature/masterwrought` (worktree `~/Documents/wocc-masterwrought`), based on `origin/release/v0.36.0`.

## Delivery contract (non-negotiable)
- The ENTIRE system ships in ONE branch and ONE PR from `feature/masterwrought`. There are
  no follow-up PRs: an item is either in this packet or explicitly CUT, never "deferred to
  a future PR". Future-content ideas (orange unique effects, next-tier upgrade chains that
  consume this tier's pieces) are recorded in brainstorm.md as future-tier design intent,
  NOT deliverables of this packet.
- Every phase STARTS by syncing the latest release branch: `git fetch origin`, merge the
  newest `origin/release/**` into `feature/masterwrought`, then run the
  `release-merge-audit` skill on the merge before any phase work.
- All ten crafting professions receive equal-shape content: one intermediate (skill 75),
  three apex products (skill 100), one capstone role (skill 125). Parity is equal prestige
  and economic role through DISTINCT levers, never identical mechanics or identical power.

## Locked design rulings (settled with the maintainer 2026-08-07; do not re-litigate)
1. R1 The above-raid step is the PERFECTING STAGE (fork B): a deliberate upgrade performed
   on an existing apex piece, consuming 1 Maker's Ember + Sundered Essence + 1 Prismstone
   Setting per attempt. It BINDS the piece, is fail-forward only (failure consumes
   materials, never harms or downgrades the piece), and the existing craft-time masterwork
   proc on an apex craft grants a head start on the stage instead of a quality bump.
   `src/sim/professions/masterwork.ts` and its locked constants are NOT modified.
2. R2 Base apex pieces are freely tradable. A piece binds at the moment Perfecting begins.
3. R3 Orange is prestige and process only in v1: unique name via Deed of Making, distinct
   visuals, crafter signature, deed credit. No unique combat effects. Sub-cap: at most ONE
   legendary-quality crafted piece equipped, inside the global cap.
4. R4 Keystone: "Maker's Ember", soulbound, 1 per week per character, BANKABLE (missed
   weeks accrue), earnable from any endgame pillar (raid, heroic five-mans, rifts).
5. R5 Power envelope: full kit (2 Perfected pieces + apex enchants + flask + food) at most
   5 percent total throughput over pre-packet raid BiS, measured via
   `docs/design/spell-balance-framework.md` before merge. Heroic raid and S-rift clear
   difficulty is the protected asset.
6. R6 A two-hander consumes ONE of the two Masterwrought cap slots.
7. R7 Boots enchant is stats only. No movement speed in v1 (rift racing).
8. R8 Recipe channels: raid and rift patterns are tradable drops (bind on learn); heroic
   five-man patterns are sold deterministically for Heroic Marks (the day-one catch-up
   valve).
9. R9 Rift core faucet: Wyrmfall Cores from A and S rank first clears, once per character
   per day (rifts have no lockout; this is the cap).
10. R10 Jewelcrafting and inscription get their BASE catalogs (0 to 50) inside this packet,
    before their apex content.
11. R11 Explicit ruling supersedes the "masterwork stays below the raid band" design intent
    for the Perfecting stage ONLY; the shipped masterwork proc math is untouched. Recorded
    here as the amendment `docs/design/professions.md` requires.
12. R12 Apex crafted epics disenchant to the standard 1 arcane_shard. Revisit only if shard
    prices misbehave post-launch.
13. R13 Skill placement: intermediates at 75, apex recipes at 100, Perfecting requires 125
    in the craft that made the piece. maxSkill stays 125. The profession XP tables are NOT
    changed; pacing lives in the new rungs' progress curve if needed.
14. R14 v1 apex items carry PURE STATS and bounded utility only. No new proc effects
    anywhere in this packet. Jewelry (stat-light slots) is pure primary stats + stamina
    with rating allocations pinned to the same-band heroic-vendor jewelry.
15. R15 IP naming: never reuse a coined term or full item name distinctive to another game.
    Every new proper noun is web-verified against the major game wikis at authoring time
    and recorded in the naming registry (below). Pre-existing shipped collisions (arcanite,
    silverleaf, and any others the audit finds) get display-name-only renames in the
    dedicated naming phase (ids are frozen and never change).
16. R16 Duplicate apex pieces: wearing two copies of the same apex item is allowed inside
    the cap (v1 pieces are pure stats, so copies are harmless). Revisit if v2 adds effects.

## Power placement (the numbers every content phase authors against)
- Budget formula: `src/sim/item_budget.ts` `primaryStatBudget`; crafted source level =
  `recipe.level` (`src/sim/item_level.ts` bumps at the ALL_RECIPES loop).
- Base apex: `recipe.level: 25`, quality `epic` -> ilvl 31 -> chest budget 22
  (heroic five-man parity, below raid 33/23).
- Perfected: instance-level bonus stats worth the delta to source 28 at epic quality
  (ilvl 34 -> chest 24), one to two points over the raid chest per slot, on at most 2 slots.
- Existing legendaries (ilvl 33 to 37, budgets 44 to 49) remain the untouched ceiling.
- Ratings (`hitRating`/`critRating`/`hasteRating`/`spellPower`) are OFF the primary budget:
  every apex piece's rating allocation is pinned against the same-band raid or
  heroic-vendor equivalent in tests. This is the throttle-proof surface; treat it as
  budgeted even though the formula does not.

## Naming registry (provisional until each phase's web verification)
Cap tag: "Unique-Equipped: Masterwrought (2)". Stage: "Perfecting".
Shared items: Wyrmfall Core (tradable making-core), Sundered Essence (bound, from breaking
down any raid epic of the tier), Maker's Ember (keystone), Apex Patterns (recipe items).
Per profession: Duskforged Billet / Forgefold Plating / Wyrmhide Cording / Sunspun Bolt /
Prismstone Setting / Precision Chassis / Quickening Catalyst / Seasoned Stock / Lucent
Reagent (intermediates); Ridgebreaker (2H), Gyrelens Array (gadget), Master's Field Forge,
Voidbound Grimoire, Grand Cauldron, The Laden Hearth (feast), Deed of Making (codex),
Lucent Infusion (Perfected-only enchant). Rejected for collisions: Vanquisher, Radiant,
Arcanite (new uses), Quintessent, Grand Banquet, Colossus Splitter, Aetherlens, Apex (tag).

## Validation matrix (per change type)
- sim-only: `npx tsc --noEmit` + affected `npx vitest run tests/<file>.ts` +
  `npx vitest run tests/architecture.test.ts`; parity suite when rng draw sites change.
- content-only: `npx tsc --noEmit` + `npx vitest run tests/progression.test.ts
  tests/recipe_economy.test.ts tests/itemization_coverage.test.ts tests/item_level.test.ts`.
- player text: `npx vitest run tests/localization_fixes.test.ts` (S3 guard) in the SAME change.
- wire/snapshots: `npx vitest run tests/snapshots.test.ts tests/env_protocol.test.ts
  tests/bandwidth.test.ts`.
- ui/render: `npx tsc --noEmit` + affected view-core tests + a mobile screenshot script.
- any code change: `npm run ci:changed` (Biome on changed files only; NEVER whole-tree --write).
- pre-merge / phase close: `node scripts/gate_select.mjs`; full `npm run gate` before the PR.

## Key existing seams (from the research; verified against v0.35.0, re-verify on v0.36.0 drift)
- Recipes: `src/sim/content/recipes.ts` (`ALL_RECIPES`), shape `ProfessionRecipeRecord`
  (`src/sim/professions/types.ts`). SUPERSEDED BY PHASE 02 (the research-era premise said
  zero users and no kind): `acquireRecipe` now has its first real caller (source 'drop',
  `src/sim/professions/pattern_items.ts`) and the `'recipe'` ItemKind exists
  (`RecipeItemDef`, `src/sim/types.ts`); no shipped content carries the kind until phase 11.
- Unique-equipped: `src/sim/equipment_rules.ts` `isUniqueEquipped` is hardcoded
  `quality === 'legendary'`; the counted Masterwrought family is NEW machinery beside it.
- Masterwork: `src/sim/professions/masterwork.ts` (pure leaf, locked constants); proc site
  `crafting.ts` (one rng draw per successful craft). DO NOT MODIFY; Perfecting is a new
  sibling module.
- Keystone template: `heroic_mark` + `awardHeroicMarks` (`src/sim/instances/dungeons.ts`),
  soulbound currency with mail overflow.
- Rift hooks: `rift_essence`/gems (`src/sim/content/rift/items.ts`, `noMarketList`),
  `craftingMaterialBias` (`src/sim/rift/types.ts`).
- Binding: `ItemDef.soulbound` (def-level) + Maker's Bond `bindOnTrade`/`boundTo`
  (`src/sim/professions/commission.ts`); no BoP/BoE concept exists.
- Item instances: `ItemInstancePayload` (`src/sim/types.ts`), `rolled.stats` is how
  Perfected bonus stats persist; `boundTo`/`charges` never leave the server.
- Consumable exclusivity: `src/sim/exclusive_aura.ts` (scrolls/flasks share elixir families).
- Stations: `STATION_TYPE_BY_CRAFT` (`src/sim/content/professions.ts`); enchanting,
  jewelcrafting, inscription have NO station today; their recipes need explicit
  `stationType` or new station content (decide in phases 05/06, record here).

## Per-phase ledger (append as phases complete)
- New IWorld members: NONE (Phase 01 decision: the client pre-check reuses the existing
  IWorldInventory reads `equipment`, `equipmentInstances`, and `inventory`; the parity pin
  is untouched).
- New SimEvents / wire fields: none (both refusals ride the existing `error` event).
- New item ids: none (Phase 01 tests use runtime-injected synthetic ids only; ids are
  frozen once shipped, append-only goldens apply).
- New i18n keys / matcher rules: `error.masterwroughtCap` + `error.masterwroughtLegendary`
  (sim matcher rows, real translations in all 20 non-en DICT blocks; the sim scope is
  invisible to the release fill worklist so English-only rows would ship forever);
  `hudChrome.itemMasterwrought` = 'Unique-Equipped: Masterwrought ({count})' with {count}
  fed from MASTERWROUGHT_EQUIP_CAP through itemNumber (five non-Latin fills in-change
  per M16; 15 Latin overlays pending for the release fill, en_CA is NOT one of them, it
  auto-resolves from en); glossary category
  `masterwroughtSystem` pins the coined per-locale renderings.
- New tests: `tests/masterwrought_cap.test.ts` (pure matrix, enforcement, guard order,
  auto-equip skip, legacy-save tolerance incl. a two-legendary over-cap save, constants +
  DICT.en cross-pins, per-locale refusal coverage over all 20 non-en DICT blocks,
  content-shape pin with isEquipSlot); `tests/masterwrought_tooltip.test.ts` (the tag
  arm on the real itemTooltip: presence, absence, coexistence with the unique tag);
  extended `tests/equip_drop_core.test.ts` (mirror cases incl. the displaced-slot
  exemption, two Sim-authority checks that assert the refusal strings, char_window
  call-site source pins); `tests/equipment_instances_wire.test.ts` (the einst
  self-snapshot decode: wire-null clears to empty map, absent keeps prior, real map
  replaces).
- Client API surface (QA addendum): `PaperdollDropAction` gained
  `'blockedMasterwroughtCap' | 'blockedMasterwroughtLegendary'` (an exhaustive switch on
  the union must add both arms) and `paperdollDropAction` gained optional params 7/8
  (`instances`, `inventory`); all three char_window.ts call sites pass both, and a source
  pin holds that wiring (omitting them silently degrades the mirror to def quality).
  src/net/online.ts einst decode hardened to `s.einst ?? {}` (a wire null can never leave
  the mirror's equipmentInstances null; delta semantics unchanged, absent keeps prior).
- Phase 01 API decisions: `masterwroughtConflictSlot(item, equipment, lookup, ignoreSlots,
  instances?, incomingQuality?)` returns `{ slot, reason: 'cap' | 'legendary' } | null`
  (the reason picks the refusal line; instance rolled.quality overrides def quality, a
  DELIBERATE difference from isUniqueEquipped which stays def-only); the unit-selection
  rule lives in equipment_rules as `equipCandidateIndex`/`equipCandidateQuality` so the
  sim consume, the sim pre-check, and the client mirror share one selection. The two
  refusal emits in items.ts MUST each stay on ONE physical line. Mechanism (QA-verified
  against the real scanner regexes, twice): on the plain-literal form a biome wrap adds
  a TRAILING COMMA that the scanner's closing-paren anchor does not match (the regex
  classes themselves span newlines); the ternary/notice forms exclude newlines outright.
  A SINGLE-LINE ternary IS visible (the `ert` regex); the original "cannot see a
  ternary" wording was wrong.
- Open items: JC/inscription station decision (phase 05/06); slot coverage audit results
  (phase 08); web-verified name confirmations (each content phase); tooltip does not yet
  state the legendary sub-cap, add the line when promotion makes it reachable (phase
  13/14); `rolled.quality` is RETIRED for new writes (crafting.ts), so the Perfecting or
  promotion phase must pick the field that carries instance legendary before the craft
  phases assume one (ruling needed by phase 12; QA sharpening: the only live writers
  stamp 'epic' on rift shell ids, so the ENTIRE sub-cap instance-override machinery is
  INERT until that ruling lands, and the phase-12 field decision should come BEFORE the
  first legendary-flagged def; keep masterwrought item ids disjoint from the rift shell
  id set, whose writer stamps rolled.quality on worn instances); promotion of a WORN
  piece bypasses the sub-cap entirely, nothing re-validates after equip, so the
  Perfecting/promotion phase must re-run the family check at promotion time or a
  character wearing two flagged epics promotes both to legendary-effective with no
  refusal (phase 12/13); when flagged content lands, extend the
  `tests/crafted_item_tooltip_coverage.test.ts` list, give the double gold tooltip line a
  copy pass, and re-check dev_kit/pbe_boost preset slot counting (phases 03/08; QA
  sharpening: pbe_boost's bisKitForRole scores by budget with no family awareness and
  buildBoostedCharacterState HARD-THROWS `boost equip failed` when a kit slot does not
  take, per class, so a flagged-heavy BiS kit is a boot-time crash, not a quiet miscount);
  the /wiki guide gear page explains unique-equipped but has no Masterwrought section
  yet, add one when content makes the tier visible (phase 08+); the packet PR's
  before/after screenshot for the tooltip tag needs a synthetic flagged item (nothing
  shipped carries the flag), decide the capture approach at PR time; the S3
  scanner's blindness to WRAPPED emits is a repo-wide guard gap worth a durable
  hardening outside this packet (a single-line ternary is visible, see the API
  decisions entry); the sim_i18n BASE_NEW locale blocks re-declare themselves after the
  `...BASE_NEW` spread and each MUST begin with its own inner `...BASE_NEW.<lang>`
  spread or every BASE_NEW fill silently shadows to English with nothing red
  (QA-verified all 8 current blocks do; the per-locale coverage test in
  masterwrought_cap.test.ts guards only the two masterwrought keys; a durable
  whole-DICT passthrough guard is a hardening candidate beside the S3 one);
  `tests/anim_pipeline_hunter_ghost.test.ts` is red AT the
  v0.36.0 release tip (inherited, files byte-identical), fix belongs upstream.
- Design notes recorded by QA (behavior as shipped, not defects): auto-equip passes
  empty ignoreSlots to the family check (mirroring the unique-rule precedent), so at
  the cap a lootable in-slot UPGRADE is silently declined where the explicit equip
  path would swap it; a player report of "my Masterwrought upgrade stopped
  auto-equipping" is designed behavior. An OVER-CAP legacy character cannot swap
  WITHIN the family at all (ignoreSlots exempts one worn slot, two others still meet
  the cap), so a three-piece legacy loadout is frozen until the player unequips down
  to the cap; acceptable for v1, flag for a ruling if legacy telemetry says otherwise.
  MasterwroughtConflict.slot is production-write-only (consumers branch on reason);
  kept for symmetry with uniqueEquipConflictSlot and future swap affordances.

## Phase 02 ledger (pattern items; two reviewed fix rounds applied 2026-08-07)
- Representation decision: a REAL new ItemKind 'recipe' via a dedicated RecipeItemDef union
  member carrying a REQUIRED teachesRecipeId (types.ts; OtherItemDef excludes 'recipe' so a
  pattern def cannot omit it). Rationale over the cheaper use.type-variant route: kind drives
  the tooltip label, junk-sell exclusion, material-taxonomy exclusion, stacking (patterns are
  in UNSTACKED_KINDS, one per slot), and the market browse bucket; a use-variant on junk/tool
  would need per-site special cases at every one of those by phase 11. Patterns join the
  market 'other' bucket (dedicated chip is phase 11's call; one-per-slot means the chip case
  strengthens as pattern count grows).
- Gate decomposition RULING: no profession-membership concept exists anywhere in the sim
  (mastery_reset seeds every ring craft at 0; resolveTrain has no wrong-profession arm), so
  the spec's three gates land as already-known (isRecipeKnown) -> profession-not-practiced
  (craftSkills value 0) -> tier-unmet (the shared teachTierMet). Deliberate divergence, on
  record: a trainer can teach a never-practiced character a tier-0 recipe; a pattern requires
  the craft to have been practiced. Deny order mirrors resolveTrain replay discipline;
  invalid content (unresolvable teachesRecipeId, or a recipe without 'drop' acquisition) is a
  SILENT no-op, guarded by the content-shape sweep below. The learn path draws zero rng.
- Learn flow: src/sim/professions/pattern_items.ts (pure resolvePatternLearn + apply arm
  behind SimContext), dispatched from the useItem kind chain BELOW the dead gate (use while
  dead is a silent no-op; usable in combat and while swimming, the potions precedent, on
  record). acquireRecipe gained its first real caller (source 'drop'); consume is exactly one
  copy by the dispatch itemId, only after acquire ok. Success emits the existing text-free
  trainResult ok event (the HUD logs training.learned and the TrainLearnTracker confirmed
  overlay flips the train row Known); NO lastTrainResult write (that stays the train-command
  probe, pinned by identity) and NO event on refusals (they are ctx.error-only, or the deny
  would double-print). Known consequence, fails closed: a pattern learn transiently
  over-reserves that recipe's trainer fee in availableTrainCopper for one broadcast.
- New i18n keys + matcher rows: error.patternKnown 'You already know that recipe.' (fills
  copied VERBATIM per locale from resolved hudChrome.training.alreadyKnown so hover and click
  agree byte for byte), error.patternProfession 'You have not practiced that profession.',
  error.patternSkill 'Your skill is too low to learn that pattern.'; all three placeholder
  free (EXACT self-registration, no RULES rows), real fills in every non-en locale block
  across BOTH dict tables (BASE_DICT in sim_i18n.ts plus BASE_NEW in sim_i18n.newlocales.ts),
  en_CA on the English floor, each emit its own single-line
  ctx.error (S3 coverage PROVEN by a byte-mutation probe; the professions directory glob at
  the corpus assembly covers pattern_items.ts, no explicit entry needed). English vocabulary
  mix is deliberate: you KNOW a recipe, you HOLD a pattern. hudChrome.pattern.teaches 'Use:
  Teaches you how to craft {item}.' with its M16 non-Latin fills, the remaining Latin
  overlays pending for the release fill. itemUi.kind.recipe 'Pattern' English plus one-word
  fills in every full overlay IN-CHANGE (deliberate deviation from English-only: keeps each locale's
  pattern-word consistent with its sim DICT refusal rows; the release fill should still
  REVIEW those words). Register clash inherited verbatim in three locales (de_DE Sie vs du,
  pl_PL plural, tr_TR formal): reconcile at the trainer key during the release fill, not here.
- Tooltip: pure core src/ui/recipe_pattern_tooltip_view.ts (UI_PURE_CORES registered) + a
  thin kind-gated hud branch (craftingIdentity read gated on kind === 'recipe' for hover
  cost). Teaches line gates on the SAME drop-acquisition predicate the resolver uses (a
  non-drop pattern renders nothing, so the hover never advertises a click the sim refuses),
  suppresses requirement/known lines while !synced, and the requirement met-state mirrors
  BOTH sim gates (practiced && tier band via tierForSkill). Reuses skillReqLine and
  training.alreadyKnown; known-state reads craftingIdentity.knownRecipes. Residual preview
  gap, on record: a skillReq-0 pattern for a never-practiced viewer previews nothing while
  the click refuses; no such content exists or is planned. Icons: recipe kind renders the
  parchment/scroll family, arm placed ABOVE the substring fish-name arm (two-sided pin).
- New IWorld members: NONE (tooltip reads the existing IWorldProfessions.craftingIdentity
  incl. its synced flag; the use round-trip rides IWorldInventory.useItem and the cprof
  delta; parity pin untouched). No wire, server-handler, or SimContext changes.
- New item ids: none (synthetic test_pattern_ ids injected at runtime only; frozen-id golden
  untouched). NO shipped content carries kind 'recipe' yet: every arm this phase adds is
  reachable in play only when phase 11 authors patterns.
- New tests: tests/recipe_pattern_items.test.ts (learn/consume both hosts incl. the real
  'use' wire command, routeEvents fan-out of the trainResult event, cprof + ClientWorld
  mirror; three refusal literals with items intact; tier boundary both sides; deny-order pin;
  silent invalid guards; dead-gate placement; zero-rng observer; real marketList; unstacked
  one-per-slot; order-insensitive 'other'-bucket pin; lastTrainResult identity pin; DICT.en +
  20-locale coverage; the vacuous-today content-shape sweep requiring teachesRecipeId to
  resolve AND the recipe to carry 'drop', with a companion pin holding the synthetic skip
  honest); tests/recipe_pattern_tooltip_view.test.ts (model/lines, dual-shape Sim +
  bareClient projections, synced and acquisition arms, sub-tier profession-gate arm both
  ways, real Hud.itemTooltip reachability); extensions to item_icons, item_kind_line,
  item_name_color, bags_view (transfer-mode matrix against literals), bag_filter (ALL-only),
  crafted_item_tooltip_coverage (pure-builder EFFECT_SOURCES row + compose pin).
- Traps recorded for later phases: ALL_RECIPES exists twice, content/recipes.ts is the array
  recipeById scans and data.ts re-exports a COPY, so tests must push the content array; the
  sim DICT is a literal-key union, so a test reading DICT.en['error.x'] is a COMPILE error
  until the matcher row lands (cross-arm coupling); adding 'drop' to a previously
  acquisition-less recipe flips isRecipeKnown from known-to-all to must-be-learned, so never
  retrofit 'drop' without grandfather care.
- Phase 11 obligations from this ledger: every authored pattern's recipe must carry 'drop'
  acquisition (the content sweep enforces it and goes live then; add a count floor); rod
  recipes must NEVER gain 'drop' or the rodFeePaid metric needs a fee-bearing discriminator
  (comment at the metric); re-point the tooltip suite's real-recipe silence arm when
  sunpetal-class content gains drops; pattern items need committed icon art or
  ITEM_ART_PENDING entries; revisit a dedicated market/bag chip as pattern count grows;
  author pattern skillReqs ON the TIER_SKILL_STEP tier boundaries or first decide the
  requirement number question (the pattern hover prints the raw skillReq while the trainer
  surfaces print the tier-band floor tierForSkill(skillReq) * TIER_SKILL_STEP; identical for
  every on-step recipe, divergent copy for an off-step one).

## Phase 02 QA ledger (audited 2026-08-07; fix round 6175c95836)
- Audit shape: seven fresh auditors (correctness + a surfaces child, rng-and-golden,
  test-decisiveness, cleanup, architecture-reviewer, cross-platform-sync, qa-checklist) over
  git diff 80d4afd062..b873eac88e on the tree with release/v0.36.0 re-merged (0fc4e544d6).
  ZERO blocking findings; every should-fix and nit applied or recorded below, none deferred.
- Refutations THIS round, both settled with the file open plus a live probe (do not
  re-raise): (1) "pattern_items.ts is not in the S3 corpus" re-raised by a sync auditor who
  read only the hand-kept readFileSync list and missed the socialSourceUnder professions
  glob; settled BOTH directions by live byte probes (DICT row edit reds s3_registered, emit
  literal edit reds s3_registered). (2) "no online-arm test exists": the online describe
  drives the real {cmd:'use'} wire command through GameServer.handleMessage with the
  routeEvents fan-out and the cprof mirror. (3) "the rod-fee invariant is unguarded prose":
  tests/professions_rod_recipes.test.ts pins each rod recipe's acquisition to exactly
  ['trainer']; the pin's message now names the rodFeePaid metric and the server comment
  cites the pin.
- Type hardening: RecipeItemDef now bars `use` and `stackSize` outright (never-fields
  beside armorType/weapon): a use payload would resolve ABOVE the recipe kind arm and the
  click would never learn; an explicit stackSize wins over UNSTACKED_KINDS in stackSizeOf.
  The suite fixtures dropped their casts so tsc guards the def shape; the one union-spread
  casualty (stack_size_tooltip_view's explicit-stackSize probes) narrows to the potion arm
  before spreading.
- New decisive pins this round, each proven by a live mutation probe (restore by EDIT,
  never checkout): the grandfathered no-acquisition fixture on BOTH suites (sim silence +
  copy intact + invalid-before-already_known on the real path; tooltip model null; reds a
  dropped optional chain on either side), the hover-click cross-check matrix (model.skillMet
  vs resolvePatternLearn cell for cell; reds a raw-compare teachTierMet), positive controls
  on the zero-rng observer plus a draw-free sweep over EVERY refusal arm (red on a neutered
  Rng observer), and the def-level tradable-drop sweep (quality not 'poor' because
  junkSellableSlot gates on QUALITY not kind; no soulbound; no noMarketList; vacuous today
  like its siblings, live the moment phase 11 ships a def).
- Kind-sweep completeness: 'recipe' joined the two stale every-non-quest-ItemKind lists
  (tests/bag_quest_mark_view.test.ts, tests/quest_item_tooltip_view.test.ts); the phase had
  updated the other two sibling lists, these two were the missed pair.
- Rulings recorded (settled, do not re-raise): patterns are NOT hotbar-placeable (comment at
  isHotbarItemId beside the reins rationale: a one-shot unlock would leave a dead button
  after its first press; elixir precedent); discard of an unlearned pattern stays the
  generic confirm (patterns are ordinary tradable items, the escalated confirm keys on
  instance payloads, classic-correct); PatternLearnResult stays exported with zero external
  consumers (it names the public resolver's return type, the training.ts TrainResult idiom);
  removeItem-by-dispatch-itemId vs def.id is unpinnable without an unshippable
  table-key-vs-def-id mismatch fixture (recorded, no change); the frozen-id golden
  (tests/shipped_item_ids.test.ts over shipped_item_ids.golden.json, a .json golden a
  .snap-only search misses) is a DELETION guard only, so "no shipped pattern ids" is
  actually held by the zero kind:'recipe' content greps plus the content-shape sweep,
  not the golden; the stale_client_rollout snapshot is a separate golden scoped to
  HEROIC_BOSS_LOOT and does not cover the catalog either.
- Docs/comment corrections: the Key existing seams recipes row (the phase itself
  superseded its zero-users/no-kind premise); the professions CLAUDE.md module map gained
  its pattern_items.ts row; the hud.ts tooltip gate comment now says WHICH host pays the
  craftingIdentity rebuild (offline Sim; the ClientWorld read is a mirrored field); the
  defense-in-depth !learned.ok comment now says unreachable today; the
  isGatheredProvenanceKind docstring places kind 'recipe' outside the signed universe; the
  market_query 'other' comment cites where the recipe arm is actually pinned; train_view's
  not-trainer-taught comment notes the mechanism now exists while content does not.
- Phase 11 obligations ADDED by this QA round (beyond the build ledger's list): decide
  vendorCountForced for a vendor-sold pattern before one ships (the count row would show
  5x/10x; surplus patterns are tradable unlike reins, so it is a decision, not a copy of
  the mount arm); scripts/mediawiki/build_seed.mjs interpolates raw item.kind into wiki
  prose and categories, so the first shipped pattern needs kind-aware wording there; add
  the 'recipe' census row to tests/material_taxonomy.test.ts when content lands (adding it
  now would red on the empty catalog); extend tests/stack_size_tooltip_view.test.ts's
  UNSTACKED-kind probe with a shipped pattern id then; icon art remains a hard landing
  blocker (ITEM_IMAGE_IDS auto-enters every non-weapon id and ITEM_ART_PENDING is
  deliberately empty, so a shipped pattern with no art 404s and reds item_icons; the
  procedural parchment arm serves only ids parked in ITEM_ART_PENDING).
