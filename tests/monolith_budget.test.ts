// The line-count RATCHET for the repo's known monolith files. Module-first is the
// doctrine (root CLAUDE.md, Modularity): new logic lands as its own sibling module
// behind an existing seam, and the coordinator files below must never GROW. Between
// v0.30.0 and v0.36.0 every sanctioned coordinator grew anyway and several new
// monoliths formed, so the doctrine gets a deterministic gate: each named file has a
// ceiling a little above its size when this gate landed. Exceeding the ceiling fails
// the suite.
//
// How to respond to a failure here:
// - The fix is EXTRACTION, not raising the ceiling: move the new logic into a sibling
//   module behind the file's seam (listed per row below; recipe in the
//   extract-and-test skill, .claude/skills/extract-and-test/) and import it.
// - After a real extraction shrinks a file, LOWER its ceiling to the new size plus a
//   small margin in the same change; the ratchet only works if it tightens.
// - Raising a ceiling is a maintainer decision: do it only when a change genuinely
//   cannot land behind a seam, keep the raise small, and justify it in the PR body.
// - A missing file usually means it was split or renamed: update or remove its row in
//   the same change so the gate tracks the real tree.
//
// Data-as-code is exempt by design (src/sim/content/, the i18n catalogs and matcher
// DICTs, generated artifacts): those tables are correctly large. This gate names only
// LOGIC files.
