// i18n source catalog: the five-player dungeon boss guides (the encounter
// journal opened from party frames or the Dungeon Finder; data modules under
// src/ui/boss_journal/dungeons/). Every line states what the encounter code
// really does (src/sim/encounters/<dungeon>/), with its numbers passed in as
// placeholders resolved per difficulty, never typed here. Cast names are NOT
// repeated: a mechanic with a cast bar reads its name from
// abilityUi.cast.<castId>, so the guide and the bar always agree.
//
// Assembled into `en` by ./index.ts under the `bossJournal` namespace.
// English here; the five non-Latin fills (M16) ride the locale overlays, the
// rest the maintainer fills at release.
